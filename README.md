Unix-Shell in C

Functionalities Implemented:

-> External and Internal commands (ls, clear, vim, cd, pwd, exit, mkdir)

-> I/O redirection (>, >>, <)

-> Handle Interrupt Signal:
   
     SIGINT has been handled (Ctrl-C). It terminates a running program.
   
     SIGTSTP has been handled (Ctrl-Z). It takes a foreground process, and runs it in the background.


To run the shell:

-> gcc shell.c

-> ./a.out
